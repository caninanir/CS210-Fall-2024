# CS 210 - Fall 2024 - Term Project
# Study Habits Analysis

## Description

This project analyzes my personal study habits by tracking the time I spend studying and sleeping each day. The aim is to gain insights into how I allocate my time through the day, identify patterns, and find areas for improvement.

## Motivation

While striving for being able to graduate, I wanted to understand how efetively I use my time. By analyzing my study habits, I aim to optimize my schedule, focus on problems that need more attention, and enhance my overall academic performance.
As I suffer from ADHD I have very sporadic study and sleep schedules. Most of my days I do not even study at all outside going to classes, but when deadlines come around I cram a good 10-12 hours and an all nighter just to make it through. This is essipecially true for exams as I cannot recall a single time I had a good nights sleep before an exam. I am hoping to change this.

## Tools

I will most likely utilize the following tools:
- **Python 3.8**
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For coding and documentation.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis.
- **Matplotlib**: Data visualization.
- **Seaborn**: Statistical data visualization.
- **NumPy**: Numerical operations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning models.

---

## Data Collection

- **Duration**: Around 30 days.
- **Method**: Manually recorded the time spent sleeping and studying each day.
- **Data Fields**:
  - `Date`: The date of that day.
  - `Wake up time`: What time I woke up that day.
  - `Study_time`: Duration of study in hours.
  - `Sleep_time`: Duration of sleep in hours.
  - `Other_time`: The remaining hours of the day where I did not study nor sleep.
  - `Midterm`: Marks days where I had exams.

---

## Data Processing

- No need as I am going to write the data from scratch. Might have to drop the days with empty entries.

---

## Data Visualizations

- **Bar Charts**: Total study time, sleep time and other time visualized.
- **Line Plots**: Daily total study time over the month. Could track if exams cause spikes.
- **Heatmaps**: Study time distribution by day of the week or by deadline.
- **Scatter Plots**: Relationship between day number and time spent. Also exam an study time.
- **Regression Lines**: Predictive analysis for future study times. (Might be too sporadic for prediction)

Visualizations will be available in the `figures` folder. (TO BE ADDED)

## Data Analysis

### Total Study Time

Will calculate the total hours spent on study and sleep for over a month to identify which parts needs improvement.

### Daily Study Patterns

Analyze how total study time varied each day, observing trends and fluctuations in daily study habits.

### Peak Study Hours

Examine which days of the week and times of the day had the highest study durations, using heatmaps to visualize the intensity of study sessions.

## Participation in Peer-Evaluation

I will participate in the peer-evaluation process by reviewing fellow students' projects and providing constructive feedback.
I am very curious about what other students have come up with.

## Repository Structure (Subject to change)

- `data/`: Contains data files.
- `scripts/`: Python scripts used for data analysis.
- `figures/`: Visualizations generated from the analysis.
- `README.md`: Project description and plan.
